    "In this workshop, we will take a hands-on approach to working with geospatial data, focusing on practical skills and foundational concepts. Using **GeoPandas**, a powerful Python library for geographic data, you will learn how to handle, analyze, and visualize spatial data efficiently.\n",

    "The workshop is structured around exercises and concepts derived from [Chapter 1: Spatial Data](https://py.geocompx.org/01-spatial-data) of the Geocomputation with Python resource. You will work with a shapefile containing information about municipalities in Colombia, but the techniques you‚Äôll learn can be applied to any geospatial dataset. Use this very notebook to go through the [Geographic data in Python section](https://py.geocompx.org/) from  Dorman et al., and answer the questions at the end of this notebook. \n",

    "* Explore and interpret the attributes and geometries within a `GeoDataFrame`.\n",
    "* Access and modify geometry data, such as centroids and boundaries.\n",
    "Perform attribute-based filtering of spatial datasets.\n",
    "* Visualize Spatial Data  using `.plot()` and `.explore()` methods.\n",
    "* Customize maps \n",
    "* Reproject spatial data to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis.\n",
